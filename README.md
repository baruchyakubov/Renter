## About
This is the final project of my course that is based on airbnb website and manages
marketplace of stays, and was built with my partner [matan bibi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matan-bibi-0a095624a/) in 10 days with vue
framework and node.js. Also has integration with buyer and host of stay using
websockets.
