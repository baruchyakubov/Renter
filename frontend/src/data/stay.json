The kitchen has everything you need with Alex and Shalia stocking it with a few basics. The neighbourhood is a little shabby, especially compared to the home we stayed in. We were told by some people in Manhattan that the neighbour of Bed-Stuy used to be very dangerous and just to be careful walking around at night. Walking from the subway after dark was a little daunting but we remained safe. We did catch a cab a few times from Manhattan as it was very late. Overall, it was a positive experience with Alex and Shalia being very helpful, even going out of their way to let us store our luggage at Shalia's work the day we were to fly out. They were great hosts.",
